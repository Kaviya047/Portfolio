        <p> Hai, I'm Kaviya, from Salem. I currently doing my B.E.Electronics and Communication Engineering in SNS College of Technology and i have completed my schooling in Vidya Vikas Matric hr.sec.School.
            I have a strong foundation in HTML,CSS,Javascript.<br>I have completed three project,they are 
            <ul><li><b>Water quality Monitoring System using Turbidity Sensor </b><br> A water quality monitoring system using a turbidity sensor measures the clarity of water. The turbidity sensor detects the cloudiness caused by particles in the water. This data is processed by a microcontroller, which can display the turbidity level on a screen or send it to a remote system for monitoring. The system is powered by a battery or other power source. This setup helps in assessing water quality by indicating the presence of suspended particles.</li></ul>
            <ul><li><b>IOT Based Theft Detection System</b><br> An IoT-based theft detection system uses sensors (like motion detectors and door/window sensors) to detect unauthorized access. When suspicious activity is detected, the system sends data to a microcontroller, which processes it and sends alerts via Wi-Fi or cellular networks to a cloud server. The server then notifies the user through a smartphone app or other interface, allowing for real-time monitoring and response.</li></ul>
            <ul><li><b>RFID Based Door Locking System</b><br> An RFID-based door locking system uses RFID tags and readers to control access. When a person with a valid RFID tag approaches the reader, the system reads the tag's unique ID. If the ID matches the stored authorized IDs, the microcontroller activates the door lock mechanism, allowing entry. This system enhances security by ensuring only authorized individuals can access the area.</li></ul>
            In addition to my academic background, I have developed strong Communication Skill and Teamwork, which I believe are essential. I am particularly passionate about Full Stack Developer, and I am eager to bring my enthusiasm and fresh perspective .
            My short term goal is to place in high level company. My long term goal is to become a successful women and make my family proud.
            my strength are I'm a hardworking person and self motivated person. </p>
